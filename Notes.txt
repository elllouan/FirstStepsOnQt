Keyword 'new' :
- allocate the number of bytes needed into the heap memory (in a row) + call the constructor : returns a pointer to the address in memory
Class* object = new Class(); (or new Class[50] for creating 50 objects)
- must use the Keyword 'delete' afterwards (equivalent to free() method in C)
delete object; (or delete[] object if it is a pointer to an array)

Use of 'connect' function : allows us to connect a SIGNAL (emitted from a QWidget) to a SLOT (a function that tells the MOC what to do)
